/* ==========================================================================
   06-LEGACY.CSS - Page-Specific & Migration Styles
   ==========================================================================
   Everything that was page-specific from the original globals.css.
   This file is explicitly allowed to be messy.
   Over time, delete these as you refactor pages to use utility classes.

   [STATUS: CLEANED UP]
   All legacy styles have been integrated into components or utility classes as of Refactor Phase 5.
